It is a classic yet effective task application where we can jot down various activities that we are interested in accomplishing. As is often the case, these tasks remain pending until they are eventually completed. Well, let's set aside the topic of completing pending tasks for now.

Returning to the technical aspect, we have a frontend that connects to a specifically prepared API to serve as our backend. This allows us to have data persistence in our own database.
